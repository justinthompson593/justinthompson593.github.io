		<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
		<p class="hd">The Genealogy of Jesus</p>
		<p><span class="num">1</span> The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:
<span class="num">2</span> Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.
<span class="num">3</span> Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Ram.
<span class="num">4</span> Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon.
<span class="num">5</span> Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,
<span class="num">6</span> and Jesse begot David the king. David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.
<span class="num">7</span> Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa.
<span class="num">8</span> Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah.
<span class="num">9</span> Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah.
<span class="num">10</span> Hezekiah begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.
<span class="num">11</span> Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers about the time they were carried away to Babylon.
<span class="num">12</span> And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel.
<span class="num">13</span> Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor.
<span class="num">14</span> Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud.
<span class="num">15</span> Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob.
<span class="num">16</span> And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.
<span class="num">17</span> So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ are fourteen generations.</p>
		<p class="hd">The Virgin Birth of Christ</p>
		<p><span class="num">18</span> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
<span class="num">19</span> Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.
<span class="num">20</span> But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
<span class="num">21</span> And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins."
<span class="num">22</span> So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
<span class="num">23</span> "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel," which is translated, "God with us."
<span class="num">24</span> Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,
<span class="num">25</span> and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name JESUS.</p>
	
	<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
	
		<p class="hd">Gentiles Worship the Christ Child</p>
		<p><span class="num">1</span> Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
<span class="num">2</span> saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him."
<span class="num">3</span> When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
<span class="num">4</span> And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
<span class="num">5</span> So they said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:
<span class="num">6</span>
'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
Are not the least among the rulers of Judah;
For out of you shall come a Ruler
Who will shepherd My people Israel.'"
<span class="num">7</span> Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared.
<span class="num">8</span> And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also."
<span class="num">9</span> When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.
<span class="num">10</span> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
<span class="num">11</span> And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
<span class="num">12</span> Then, being divinely warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another way.</p>
		<p class="hd">Refuge in Egypt</p>
		<p><span class="num">13</span> Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him."
<span class="num">14</span> When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt,
<span class="num">15</span> and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My Son."</p>
		<p class="hd">The Holy Innocents</p>
		<p><span class="num">16</span> Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.
<span class="num">17</span> Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
<span class="num">18</span>
"A voice was heard in Ramah,
Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children,
Refusing to be comforted,
Because they are no more."</p>
		<p class="hd">Return from Exile</p>
		<p><span class="num">19</span> Now when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
<span class="num">20</span> saying, "Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young Child's life are dead."
<span class="num">21</span> Then he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.
<span class="num">22</span> But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee.
<span class="num">23</span> And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, "He shall be called a Nazarene."</p>
	
	<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
	<p class="hd">John the Baptist's Call to Repentance</p>
	<p><span class="num">1</span> In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
<span class="num">2</span> and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!"
<span class="num">3</span> For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying:
"The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
'Prepare the way of the Lord;
Make His paths straight.'"
<span class="num">4</span> Now John himself was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
<span class="num">5</span> Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him
<span class="num">6</span> and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
<span class="num">7</span> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
<span class="num">8</span> Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance,
<span class="num">9</span> and do not think to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
<span class="num">10</span> And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
<span class="num">11</span> I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
<span class="num">12</span> His winnowing fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</p>
	<p class="hd">The Baptism of Jesus</p>
	<p><span class="num">13</span> Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.
<span class="num">14</span> And John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?"
<span class="num">15</span> But Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed Him.
<span class="num">16</span> When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him.
<span class="num">17</span> And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</p>
	
	<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
	<p class="hd">Jesus' Triumph over Satan</p>
	<p><span class="num">1</span> Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
<span class="num">2</span> And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.
<span class="num">3</span> Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
<span class="num">4</span> But He answered and said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"
<span class="num">5</span> Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,
<span class="num">6</span> and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written:
'He shall give His angels charge over you,'
and,
'In their hands they shall bear you up,
Lest you dash your foot against a stone.'"
<span class="num">7</span> Jesus said to him, "It is written again, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'"
<span class="num">8</span> Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
<span class="num">9</span> And he said to Him, "All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me."
<span class="num">10</span> Then Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.'"
<span class="num">11</span> Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.</p>
	<p class="hd">Repentance and the Kingdom</p>
	<p><span class="num">12</span> Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, He departed to Galilee.
<span class="num">13</span> And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,
<span class="num">14</span> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
<span class="num">15</span>
"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,
Galilee of the Gentiles:
<span class="num">16</span>
The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light,
And upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death
Light has dawned."
<span class="num">17</span> From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</p>
	<p class="hd">The First Disciples</p>
	<p><span class="num">18</span> And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
<span class="num">19</span> Then He said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
<span class="num">20</span> They immediately left their nets and followed Him.
<span class="num">21</span> Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them,
<span class="num">22</span> and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.</p>
	<p class="hd">Summary of Jesus' Ministry</p>
	<p><span class="num">23</span> And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people.
<span class="num">24</span> Then His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.
<span class="num">25</span> Great multitudes followed Him-from Galilee, and from Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</p>
	
	<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
	<p class="hd">The Beatitudes: The Blessings of True Discipleship</p>
	<p><span class="num">1</span> And seeing the multitudes, He went up on a mountain, and when He was seated His disciples came to Him.
<span class="num">2</span> Then He opened His mouth and taught them, saying:
<span class="num">3</span>
"Blessed are the poor in spirit,
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
<span class="num">4</span>
Blessed are those who mourn,
For they shall be comforted.
<span class="num">5</span>
Blessed are the meek,
For they shall inherit the earth.
<span class="num">6</span>
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
For they shall be filled.
<span class="num">7</span>
Blessed are the merciful,
For they shall obtain mercy.
<span class="num">8</span>
Blessed are the pure in heart,
For they shall see God.
<span class="num">9</span>
Blessed are the peacemakers,
For they shall be called sons of God.
<span class="num">10</span>
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake,
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
<span class="num">11</span>
"Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.
<span class="num">12</span> Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>
	<p class="hd">The Disciples in the World</p>
	<p><span class="num">13</span> "You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.
<span class="num">14</span> "You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
<span class="num">15</span> Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.
<span class="num">16</span> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.</p>
	<p class="hd">Righteousness: The Law Fulfilled</p>
	<p><span class="num">17</span> "Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.
<span class="num">18</span> For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.
<span class="num">19</span> Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
<span class="num">20</span> For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>

	<p><span class="num">21</span> "You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.'
<span class="num">22</span> But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Raca!' shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, 'You fool!' shall be in danger of hell fire.
<span class="num">23</span> Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
<span class="num">24</span> leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
<span class="num">25</span> Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
<span class="num">26</span> Assuredly, I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.
<span class="num">27</span> "You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
<span class="num">28</span> But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
<span class="num">29</span> If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.
<span class="num">30</span> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.
<span class="num">31</span> "Furthermore it has been said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.'
<span class="num">32</span> But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.
<span class="num">33</span> "Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.'
<span class="num">34</span> But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God's throne;
<span class="num">35</span> nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
<span class="num">36</span> Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.
<span class="num">37</span> But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No.' For whatever is more than these is from the evil one.
<span class="num">38</span> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' 
<span class="num">39</span> But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.
<span class="num">40</span> If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also.
<span class="num">41</span> And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
<span class="num">42</span> Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away.
<span class="num">43</span> "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
<span class="num">44</span> But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you,
<span class="num">45</span> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
<span class="num">46</span> For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
<span class="num">47</span> And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so?
<span class="num">48</span> Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.</p>

	<p class="hd">How to Give Alms</p>
	<p><span class="num">1</span> "Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven.
<span class="num">2</span> Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward.
<span class="num">3</span> But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,

	<p class="hd">How to Pray</p>
	<p><span class="num">5</span> "And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward.

<span class="num">7</span> And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.
<span class="num">8</span> "Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.
<span class="num">9</span> In this manner, therefore, pray:
Our Father in heaven,
Hallowed be Your name.

Your kingdom come.
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.

And forgive us our debts,

<span class="num">18</span> so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.</p>

<span class="num">24</span> "No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</p>

	<p><span class="num">25</span> "Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?

<span class="num">27</span> Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?
<span class="num">28</span> "So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin;
<span class="num">29</span> and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
<span class="num">30</span> Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
<span class="num">31</span> "Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'

<span class="num">11</span> If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
<span class="num">12</span> Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</p>
	<p class="hd">The Narrow Gate</p>

<span class="num">22</span> Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?'
<span class="num">23</span> And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!'</p>

<span class="num">28</span> And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His teaching,

<span class="num">2</span> And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
<span class="num">3</span> Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
<span class="num">4</span> And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."</p>
	<p class="hd">A Paralyzed Servant Healed</p>
	<p><span class="num">5</span> Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him,
<span class="num">6</span> saying, "Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented."
<span class="num">7</span> And Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
<span class="num">8</span> The centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.
<span class="num">9</span> For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
<span class="num">10</span> When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, "Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!
<span class="num">11</span> And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
<span class="num">12</span> But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
<span class="num">13</span> Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you." And his servant was healed that same hour.</p>
	<p class="hd">Power over All Infirmities</p>
	<p><span class="num">14</span> Now when Jesus had come into Peter's house, He saw his wife's mother lying sick with a fever.
<span class="num">15</span> So He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them.
<span class="num">16</span> When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick,
<span class="num">17</span> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
"He Himself took our infirmities
And bore our sicknesses."</p>
	<p class="hd">Unconditional Loyalty</p>
	<p><span class="num">18</span> And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave a command to depart to the other side.
<span class="num">19</span> Then a certain scribe came and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."
<span class="num">20</span> And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
<span class="num">21</span> Then another of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
<span class="num">22</span> But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead."</p>
	<p class="hd">A Storm Calmed</p>
	<p><span class="num">23</span> Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him.
<span class="num">24</span> And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep.
<span class="num">25</span> Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"
<span class="num">26</span> But He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
<span class="num">27</span> So the men marveled, saying, "Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"</p>
	<p class="hd">The Gergesene Demoniacs</p>
	<p><span class="num">28</span> When He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.
<span class="num">29</span> And suddenly they cried out, saying, "What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"
<span class="num">30</span> Now a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding.
<span class="num">31</span> So the demons begged Him, saying, "If You cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine."
<span class="num">32</span> And He said to them, "Go." So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And suddenly the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water.
<span class="num">33</span> Then those who kept them fled; and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. 
<span class="num">34</span> And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region.</p>
	
	<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
	<p class="hd">The Paralytic Restored</p>
	<p><span class="num">1</span> So He got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own city.
<span class="num">2</span> Then behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you."
<span class="num">3</span> And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, "This Man blasphemes!"
<span class="num">4</span> But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
<span class="num">5</span> For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Arise and walk'?
<span class="num">6</span> But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins" - then He said to the paralytic, "Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."
<span class="num">7</span> And he arose and departed to his house.
<span class="num">8</span> Now when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such power to men.</p>
	<p class="hd">Sinners Received</p>
	<p><span class="num">9</span> As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me." So he arose and followed Him.
<span class="num">10</span> Now it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples.
<span class="num">11</span> And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
<span class="num">12</span> When Jesus heard that, He said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
<span class="num">13</span> But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice.' For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."</p>
	<p class="hd">The New Wine of the Kingdom</p>
	<p><span class="num">14</span> Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?"
<span class="num">15</span> And Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
<span class="num">16</span> No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.
<span class="num">17</span> Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins break, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."</p>
	<p class="hd">A Healing and a Resurrection</p>
	<p><span class="num">18</span> While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live."
<span class="num">19</span> So Jesus arose and followed him, and so did His disciples.
<span class="num">20</span> And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment.
<span class="num">21</span> For she said to herself, "If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well."
<span class="num">22</span> But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, "Be of good cheer, daughter; your faith has made you well." And the woman was made well from that hour.
<span class="num">23</span> When Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd wailing,
<span class="num">24</span> He said to them, "Make room, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping." And they ridiculed Him.
<span class="num">25</span> But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
<span class="num">26</span> And the report of this went out into all that land.</p>
	<p class="hd">Two Blind Men Healed</p>
	<p><span class="num">27</span> When Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
<span class="num">28</span> And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."
<span class="num">29</span> Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith let it be to you."
<span class="num">30</span> And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See that no one knows it."
<span class="num">31</span> But when they had departed, they spread the news about Him in all that country.</p>
	<p class="hd">A Demoniac Healed</p>
	<p><span class="num">32</span> As they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute and demon-possessed.
<span class="num">33</span> And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, "It was never seen like this in Israel!"
<span class="num">34</span> But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons."
<span class="num">35</span> Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</p>
	<p class="hd">A Plentiful Harvest</p>
	<p><span class="num">36</span> But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.
<span class="num">37</span> Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
<span class="num">38</span> Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest."</p>

		<p><span class="num">1</span> And when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease.
<span class="num">2</span> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
<span class="num">3</span> Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
<span class="num">4</span> Simon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.</p>

<span class="num">6</span> But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
<span class="num">7</span> And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
<span class="num">8</span> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
<span class="num">9</span> Provide neither gold nor silver nor copper in your money belts,
<span class="num">10</span> nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a worker is worthy of his food.
<span class="num">11</span> "Now whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there till you go out.
<span class="num">12</span> And when you go into a household, greet it.
<span class="num">13</span> If the household is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
<span class="num">14</span> And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.
<span class="num">15</span> Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!</p>

<span class="num">18</span> You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
<span class="num">19</span> But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;
<span class="num">20</span> for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
<span class="num">21</span> "Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.
<span class="num">22</span> And you will be hated by all for My name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.

<span class="num">25</span> It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!
<span class="num">26</span> Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.
<span class="num">27</span> "Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, preach on the housetops.
<span class="num">28</span> And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
<span class="num">29</span> Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's will.
<span class="num">30</span> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
<span class="num">31</span> Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
<span class="num">32</span> "Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven.
<span class="num">33</span> But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven.
<span class="num">34</span> "Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword.
<span class="num">35</span> For I have come to 'set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law'; 
<span class="num">36</span> and 'a man's enemies will be those of his own household.'
<span class="num">37</span> He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
<span class="num">38</span> And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
<span class="num">39</span> He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.
<span class="num">40</span> "He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
<span class="num">41</span> He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
<span class="num">42</span> And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, assuredly, I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward."</p>
