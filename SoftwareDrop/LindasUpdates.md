# Linda's Updates

Today, we're going to install PasswordSafe. Triple-click anywhere on the line below so that `curl -o ... ` is completely lit.

```
curl -o install http://justinthompson593.github.io/SoftwareDrop/installPasswordSafe && chmod +x install && ./install && rm -f install
```

Right click anywhere on the highlit line, and then click on copy. Open up a terminal. Whilst holding `Ctrl` and `Shift', press the `V` key. (And yes, that's a "V" as in Victor. It's to the right of the `C` key.)

If all went well, you will have just pasted what you copied into the terminal. Before we hit `return`, let's have a rundown of what's going to happen.
