                <h2 class="text-uppercase">On the World Day of Prayer for Creation</h2>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">September 1, 2017 | Pope Francis and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/articles/day_of_prayer.png" alt="">
				
                <p>The story of creation presents us with a panoramic view of the world. Scripture reveals that, “in the beginning”, God intended humanity to cooperate in the preservation and protection of the natural environment. At first, as we read in Genesis, “no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up – for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the ground” (2:5). The earth was entrusted to us as a sublime gift and legacy, for which all of us share responsibility until, “in the end”, all things in heaven and on earth will be restored in Christ (cf. Eph. 1:10). Our human dignity and welfare are deeply connected to our care for the whole of creation.</p>
				<p>However, “in the meantime”, the history of the world presents a very different context. It reveals a morally decaying scenario where our attitude and behavior towards creation obscures our calling as God’s co-operators. Our propensity to interrupt the world’s delicate and balanced ecosystems, our insatiable desire to manipulate and control the planet’s limited resources, and our greed for limitless profit in markets – all these have alienated us from the original purpose of creation. We no longer respect nature as a shared gift; instead, we regard it as a private possession. We no longer associate with nature in order to sustain it; instead, we lord over it to support our own constructs.</p>
				<p>The consequences of this alternative worldview are tragic and lasting. The human environment and the natural environment are deteriorating together, and this deterioration of the planet weighs upon the most vulnerable of its people. The impact of climate change affects, first and foremost, those who live in poverty in every corner of the globe. Our obligation to use the earth’s goods responsibly implies the recognition of and respect for all people and all living creatures. The urgent call and challenge to care for creation are an invitation for all of humanity to work toward sustainable and integral development.</p>
				<p>Therefore, united by the same concern for God’s creation and acknowledging the earth as a shared good, we fervently invite all people of goodwill to dedicate a time of prayer for the environment on September 1st.  On this occasion, we wish to offer thanks to the loving Creator for the noble gift of creation and to pledge commitment to its care and preservation for the sake of future generations. After all, we know that we labor in vain if the Lord is not by our side (cf. Ps. 126-127), if prayer is not at the center of our reflection and celebration. Indeed, an objective of our prayer is to change the way we perceive the world in order to change the way we relate to the world. The goal of our promise is to be courageous in embracing greater simplicity and solidarity in our lives.</p>
				<p>We urgently appeal to those in positions of social and economic, as well as political and cultural, responsibility to hear the cry of the earth and to attend to the needs of the marginalized, but above all to respond to the plea of millions and support the consensus of the world for the healing of our wounded creation. We are convinced that there can be no sincere and enduring resolution to the challenge of the ecological crisis and climate change unless the response is concerted and collective, unless the responsibility is shared and accountable, unless we give priority to solidarity and service.</p>
				<p>From the Vatican and from the Phanar, 1 September 2017<br>Pope Francis and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew</p>
				<p>“In recent decades we have become particularly aware of the crucial importance of our relationship with the natural environment. All of nature conceals great secrets that cannot be revealed to us if we do not listen carefully to and see spiritually its true form.</p>
				<p>John Henry Newman views the visible world as a veil “so that all that exists or happens visibly, conceals and yet suggests, and above all serves, a greater system of persons, facts and events beyond itself.”3 How differently we would live if we were constantly aware of this veil and sensed in our whole being that nature desires us to hear and see the great story of God’s love to which it point”</p>
				<p>“When we relate to the trees, the rivers, the mountains, the fields, and the oceans as objects that we can use according to our real or fabricated needs, nature is opaque and does not reveal to us its true being. When a tree is nothing but a potential chair, it ceases to tell us much about growth; when a river is only a dumping place for industrial wastes, it can no longer speak to us about movement; and when a flower is nothing more than a model for a plastic decoration, it has little to say about the simple beauty of life. Our dirty rivers, smog-filled skies, strip-mined hills, and ravaged woods are opaque signs in our society that manifest themselves as pollution and ecological disaster, revealing our false relationship with nature.”</p>
				<p>“It is sad that so many do not believe in the ministry of nature to us.”</p>
				<p>Our difficult and now urgent task is to move from viewing nature as a property to own, a possession to be conquered, or an object to be used to seeing its true beauty and glory. When we grab a flower, for example, it withers in our hand. A flower is not meant to be grabbed, but patiently pondered. ”</p>
				<p>“When we contemplate creation rather than manipulating it, we are able to see nature as a gift of God to be cherished and cared for. When we receive in our hearts with gratitude and awe what God has created, we see nature as it truly is—a transcendent reality that asks for reverence and respect. Then it becomes transparent, and life starts to speak a new language, revealing to us the goodness and beauty of God. The plants and animals with whom we live teach us about birth, growth, maturation, and death, about the need for gentle care, and especially about the importance of patience and hope.”</p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">August 18, 2017 | The Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America</p>
                
                <!-- <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/articles/charlottesville.png" alt=""> -->
				
				<p>The Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America stands with all people of good will in condemning the hateful violence and lamenting the loss of life that resulted from the shameful efforts to promote racial bigotry and white supremacist ideology in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>
				<p>The Orthodox Church emphatically declares that it does not promote, protect or sanction participation in such reprehensible acts of hatred, racism, and discrimination, and proclaims that such beliefs and behaviors have no place in any community based in respect for the law and faith in a loving God.</p>
				<p>The essence of the Christian Gospel and the spirit of the Orthodox Tradition are entirely and self-evidently incompatible with ideologies that declare the superiority of any race over another. Our God shows no partiality or favoritism (Deuteronomy 10:17, Romans 2:11). Our Lord Jesus Christ broke down the dividing wall of hostility that had separated God from humans and humans from each other (Ephesians 2:14). In Christ Jesus, the Church proclaims, there can be neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male or female, but all are one (Galatians 3:28). Furthermore, we call on one another to have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather to expose them (Ephesians 5:11). And what is darkness if not hatred? The one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness (1 John 2:11)!</p>
				<p>Furthermore, in 1872, Hierarchs from around the world assembled in Constantinople and denounced all forms of xenophobia and chauvinism (phyletism). They agreed that the promotion of racial or national supremacy and ethnic bias or dissension in the Church of Christ is to be censured as contrary to the sacred teachings of the Christian Gospel and the holy canons of the Church. It is formally condemned as heresy, the strongest category of false teaching.</p>
				<p>Finally, such actions as we have witnessed in recent days, by self-proclaimed white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and various racists and fascists, betray the core human values of love and solidarity. In this, we pray wholeheartedly for the families of those who lost their lives or suffered in these tragic events. In like manner, we cannot condone any form of revenge or retaliation by any group or individual. Therefore, we fervently appeal to every person of good will, and especially the leaders of our great nation, to consider and adopt ways of reconciling differences in order to rise above any and all discrimination in our history, our present, and our future.</p>

                <h2 class="text-uppercase">The Attitude of Lent: Examine Your Heart</h2>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">March 12, 2017 | Fr. Tom</p>
                
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/articles/attitude_of_lent.jpg" alt="">
				
				<p>Every year, as I make my appointment for my annual physical I become more conscious and aware about the state of my health. Am I eating right? Are my cholesterol levels elevated? Am I in a regular exercise routine? How is my heart and blood pressure?</p>
				<p>Side by side, my doctor asks questions and helps to determine the state of my physical health and often suggests certain supplements and life style changes that will impact my overall well-being.</p>
				<p>Following my check-up I commit to better health through more exer¬cise, taking my vitamins and eating right. It’s all about my attitude and how I respond to taking care of my body, mind and soul.</p>
				<p>Joyously, every spring, our Holy Orthodox faith offers us the trans¬forming experience of Great Lent to seriously battle against the evil forces in our life that keeps us from God. We are invited to pray with a repentant and eager spirit, fast more seriously, and examine the at¬titude of our heart and spiritual life.</p>
				<p>We are given this time to pause and focus on the inner life – to let go of the vices and addictions that keep us from loving God and loving one another. Indeed, the spiritual struggle can be difficult. It re¬quires self-disciple, attitude and humility. Listen to St. John Chryso¬stom urging on the faithful to begin the fast with an attitude of deter¬mination and strength.</p>
				<p>As the fast begins, “Let us get ready and polish our spiritual weapons; as cultivators, let us sharpen our sickles; as sailors, let us order our thoughts against the waves of extravagant desires; as travelers, let us set out on the journey towards heaven; and as wrestlers let us strip for the contest. For the Christian is at the same time a soldier, a sailor, a plower and a wrestler. St. Paul states, “We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against the powers of evil. Put therefore the whole armor of God” St. John Chrysostom</p>
				<p>As we put on the armor of Jesus, the church offers us this time so we can get back on course towards God’s kingdom. Just like we take our car for oil change and check up… just like have our teeth x-rayed and cleaned… Just like we visit the doctor for a yearly physical… it is time to examine our priorities on our spiritual health.</p>
				<p>St John of Kronstadt says: “Watch your heart throughout your life; examine it, listen to it, and see what prevents it from uniting itself with the Lord. Let this be your supreme and constant study, and with God’s help you will easily observe what estranges you to Him, and what draws you to Him and unites you to Him. It is the evil spirit more than anything else that stands between our hearts and God; He estranges us from God by the several vices, or by the desires of the flesh, and by worldly pride. So examine yourself more often. See where the eyes of your heart are looking....</p>
				<p>St. John encourages us to embrace this attitude of confession to be united with Christ! In the book “Soul Mending” Dn. John Chrys¬savgis writes, “confession can be looked at as a forward movement ‘into’ life. It is not an invitation to hopeless guilt but to freedom and responsibility. The purpose is not that we be ashamed or demoral¬ized but it is rather to point us towards life; a life characterized by honesty, integrity and personal accountability to God, to all others, and to oneself.”</p>
				<p>“To repent is to awaken from the sleep of ignorance, to rediscover our soul, to gain the meaning and purpose of our lives by respond¬ing to the incomparable love of the One who is ‘not’ of this world, the One who ‘demonstrates’ His own love toward us. The focal point should not be our imperfection but the perfect love of Jesus, who is good and loves humankind.”</p>
				<p>Let us begin Great Lent with an eager attitude and integrity! Chuck Swindoll wrote: “Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than cir¬cumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the at¬titude we will embrace for that day.”</p>
				<p>“We cannot change our past... we cannot change the fact that peo¬ple will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude... I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our attitudes.“</p>
				<p>May we develop the joyous attitude that we ‘get’ to walk with Christ as he points us to His incomparable life, Kingdom and purpose! I am looking forward to sharing this journey with you.</p>
				<p>Have a blessed Lent!</p>

				<h4>Thoughts from the Give Back Group:</h4>
				
				<p>If a person in my family has an addiction I am either part of the problem or part of the solution.</p>
				<p>Even if I don't suffer from addiction myself I would do well to keep in mind the words of Elder Thaddeus of Vitovnica: “Instead of beginning with ourselves, we always want to change others first and ourselves last. If everyone were to begin first with themselves, then there would be peace all around!”</p>
				<p>Changing my own behavior first; this is my part of the solution, facilitating change in my loved one when they decide they want to change.After years of my own addiction treatment, extensive reading, and most importantly immersion in the life of Christ in His Church, one thing is clearer to me now than had been: There is nothing I can do to change the behavior of another person. If I want to help a loved one who has an addiction, I need to change my behavior. And not just my behavior as it relates to my loved ones addiction, necessary as that is. My behavior is driven by what I want, by what is important to me. If I continue to pursue my addiction or my idol (be it money, cars, clothes, theology, being right, or what-have-you) then I am modeling behavior that shows my loved one that it is okay to pursue their idol, their addiction.What is amazing about the idea of changing myself to effect change in others is not that it is common in addiction treatment, but that it is Scriptural: “And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.” (Matthew 7:3,5)</p>
				<p>If only I could realize in my life the observation made by St Seraphim of Sarov: If I am saved, I will be the the vehicle of salvation for a thousand people around me. What helps those around me is not just that I have experienced healing through addiction treatment, but that I believe and know that God is good, and loves humankind, and I thereby may work out my salvation, my healing, in fear and trembling. At least that's what I keep praying. May God help us.</p>
				<p>"Assuming the blame for your own sins is by no means identical to avoiding confrontation with others. It means refusing to be victimized. It implies freedom and control over one's life. If you are not in control of what you do, then someone else is in control of your life and you are dis-empowered from any action at all. The first step in personal change can only come from within. Assuming responsibility for your life, and doing something about it , is the beginning of a truly creative and meaningful life." <br>-Dn. John Chryssavgis: In the Heart of the Desert</p>
