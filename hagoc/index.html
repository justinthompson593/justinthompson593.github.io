				<h4>The Divine Liturgy</h4>
                <p>“Liturgy” translated from the Greek means “work of the people.” Orthodox people throughout the world join together for this “work” of worship.  We not only proclaim the Kingdom of God, we believe that for the space and time of the liturgy we actually enter into the Kingdom. The Divine Liturgy is not a show, entertainment or theatre. It is a spiritual entrance into and experience of God's eternal kingdom. It is our personal and corporate expression of our sacramental and liturgical relationship with God. The Liturgy is not a static experience, but a dynamic journey ~ A journey to and through the kingdom of heaven. It is our entry into another reality..  Since worship in Orthodoxy is an expression of the entire Church, the active participation and involvement of the congregation is strongly encouraged.  Please sing along and participate with us. Worshiping with our whole being In Orthodox worship, everything points towards the heavenly.  </p>
				<p>Accordingly, worship calls not only for the action of mind, the emotions, and the will, but also of the body with all its senses.  So, as the Scriptures describe, in worship there are things to see, hear, touch, taste, and smell. Since God wants us to offer our entire being to Him in worship and service, every one of our senses are also asked to actively participate in heavenly worship.</p>
				<h4>Candles</h4>
				<p>Orthodox Christians light a candle when entering the church as a reminder of Christ’s light in the world and the warmth  of God’s love.</p>
				<h4>Surrounded by Icons</h4>
				<p>Icons are the images of Christ, Angels, and the Saints which adorn the interior of the Church. They are a witness to the abiding presence of God and His Kingdom on earth. Icons are used in prayer and as a means of “windows into heaven” for the Orthodox Christian.  The icon screen is not meantto separate but is there to remind us that we are outside of God’s kingdom knocking and asking the Lord to allow us to come in.</p>
				<h4>Sign of the Cross</h4>
				<p>The faithful frequently make the sign of the cross when praying, to remind themselves both of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross and ever present power of the life-giving cross. We bless ourselves as we express our devotion to Christ and identify ourselves as Christians as we make this sign of the cross.</p>
				<h4>Music</h4>
				<p>The melodies you will hear have come down virtually unaltered since the beginning of Christianity and  have not lost any of their beauty.  Led by our chanters, our congregation sings almost everything during the Divine Liturgy.  We invite you to join in. Don't be afraid; everyone is encouraged to sing. God gave you the voice you have and it is sweet music to His ears. </p>
				<h4>Incense</h4>
				<p>Incense is a special offering to God. It is also a symbol of prayer that ascends to God from human hearts which have been purified by the grace of the Holy Spirit. (Revelation 8: 3-5) You will notice that the priest offers incense to the icons and congregations to remind us that Christ is the icon (image) of the invincible God (Colossians 1:15) and we are created in the image of God.  The twelve bells on the censer reminds us of the message of “Good News” proclaimed by the twelve apostles. </p>
				<h4>Posture of Prayer</h4>
				<p>One thing you may notice is that most of the people are standing.  In the beginning, Christians stood rather than sat because this has always been the preferred posture for prayer.  We always stand out of reverence for the Holy Scriptures when the Gospel is read.  Through the years, as churches evolved, some have added seating. In the Orthodox tradition, the faithful stand through most of the worship service.  If you get tired, don’t hesitate to sit down. </p>
				<h4>Liturgy of the Word</h4>
				<p>Of all the creatures God created, man alone is unique. Man alone is rational. Man is the only one to receive the divine gift of speech. Only man blesses. It is common and natural for us to gather to bless bread, oil, water, food, our homes, ourselves, and the sum total of our 2 existence. First, though, we bless the name of God and His eternal kingdom ~ a name above all names and the kingdom we all desire to inherit. The Divine Liturgy begins with the words, “Blessed is the Kingdom of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.”</p>
				<p>These first words of the Liturgy announce to us where we are and in whose presence we stand.  All the sacraments, or mysteries as we Orthodox call them, begin with this same declaration. The Priest blesses the Altar Table with the Book of the gospels by making the sign of the cross with it.
The first half of the Liturgy focuses on the "Word of God" which is revealed in the Holy Scriptures. During the first half of the Liturgy we sing several hymns and psalms - called 'Antiphons,' we hear readings from the Epistles and Gospels, and listen attentively to the sermon preached by our 
priest.  "Sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God" (Colossians 3:16)</p>
				<h4>The Small Entrance</h4>
				<p>Up until this moment, we have asked Christ our God to come and save us, and we have made a short confession of who Christ is in the Hymn “The only-begotten Son and Word of God.”  Now we are preparing to witness the Small Entrance. The Gospel, which records the life and teachings of our Lord, will be brought in solemn procession to the center of the Church. This act is a manifestation of the beginning of Christ's public ministry, His entrance into the world. Earlier, we asked Christ to come into our midst; now He does come; present in the words, teachings, and miracles of His Gospel.As the Priest stands in the center of the Church with the Book of Gospels held high, it is Christ Himself who stands before us. The Priest sings along with the people: "O come let us worship and bow down to Christ!"  It is proper at this time to show reverence to Christ by bowing our heads as a sign of submission to God, and by marking ourselves with the sign of the Cross. These small gestures are all signs of our comprehension that Christ stands before us. </p>
				<h4>Special Hymns</h4>
				<p>After this, we sing hymns, (page numbers found in the Sunday bulletin) which honor the Resurrection, the Patron Saints of our Church of the Holy Apostles, and hymns of the saints of the day that we celebrate.  All these hymns of remembrance, honor, and praise climax with the 
chanting of the Angelic Hymn:  HOLY GOD, HOLY MIGHTY, HOLY IMMORTAL, HAVE MERCY ON US. This ancient and scriptural hymn is sung three times, just as there are three persons in the Holy Trinity. As we praise the triune God, we can only feel for ourselves a sense of awe and dependency as we ask the Trinity to have mercy on us. </p>
				<h4>Epistle and Gospel Readings</h4>
				<p>At the conclusion of this hymn we hear the proclamation of the lessons for the day. Two readings are offered at every Divine Liturgy. One is from Acts or one of the letters of the Apostles and the other is from one of the four Gospels. They are meant to be teachings and admonitions for us. At this point in the Liturgy, Christ is again in our midst and He speaks to us through the Holy Scriptures. We become like those who saw Him in His earthly life. We stand in the desert, on the mountainside, and at the seashore attentive to His teachings and messages of salvation.  As we hear the words proclaimed we can acknowledge in heart and soul that He is the true Teacher and the only source of profitable wisdom. </p>
				<h4>The Homily (Sermon)</h4>
				<p>After the readings, we hear our priest give a sermon, which highlights the Gospel message and how we can apply it to our daily lives. You can watch some of Holy Apostles' sermons <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HolyApostlesGO/videos">here</a>.</p>
				<h4>The Cherubic Hymn</h4>
				<p>We begin this second part of the Liturgy  with the Cherubic Hymn. “Let us who mystically represent the Cherubim and sing the thrice-holy hymn to the life giving Trinity, set a side all cares of this life, that we may receive the King of all… ” This 6th  century chant introduces the realities to be experienced in the next part of the Liturgy and opens the door to the Sacrament of Holy Eucharist.  Soon we will join the Cherubim in singing the “Holy, Holy, Holy,” The priest will exhort us to lift hearts and to lay aside all earthly cares.  What else can we then say but “Alleluia.” </p>
				<h4>The Liturgy of the Faithful</h4>
				<p>The second half of the Liturgy, focuses on the offering of the bread and the wine to be transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ.  The bread for the Communion is specially baked by a parishioner for each service.  It is a small offering of thanksgiving.  While we offer simple bread, Christ in turn, gives us Himself through the Holy Sacrament of Communion.  </p>
				<h4>Kiss of Peace</h4>
				<p>As Christ told His followers, "Love one another, as I have loved you," the Priest proclaims, "Let us love one another, so that with one mind we may confess..." We complete the sentence:  "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. the Trinity, One in essence and inseparable." This is what we confess and what binds us together. We confess a common faith in the Trinity with the assurance that the love of that Trinity binds us together in community. We kiss each other before we receive communion ("Greet one another with a kiss of love," 1 Peter 5:14).  The usual greeting is "Christ is in our midst" and response, "He is and always shall be." Don't worry if you forget what to say.  If someone extends a hand, they are warmly welcoming you into our community of faith.  Exchanging the kiss of peace is a liturgical act, a sign of mystical unity. Chatting and fellowship is for later.</p>
				<h4>Our Confession of Faith - The Creed</h4>
				<p>The next part of the Liturgy is a dialogue. None of the Priest's statements are complete. They require the response from the faithful. We will hear the words, "The doors, the doors; in wisdom let us be attentive!" In the history of our Church, during times of persecution, the meeting place of the Church had to be secured for fear of her enemies. It is still an ancient reminder that this part of the Liturgy that leads us to Holy Communion is reserved for those who are the baptized, chrismated, practicing faithful. It must also be mentioned that the Creed, our confession of faith, is now said before the reception of Holy Communion. We publicly declare our common faith before we are united in the Chalice. Our common cup is the visible sign of our unity in faith. When the recitation of the Creed is complete the Priest pronounces the ancient and apostolic blessing:  "The grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all." With this blessing echoing in the Church, we are called to lift up our hearts and to give thanks. This is the attitude we are called to acquire during the consecration of the Holy Gifts. It is important for us to abide in a proper state of gratitude to God as we make our simple offering of bread and wine to Him. </p>
				<h4>Holy Communion</h4>
				<p>As the conclusion of the angelic hymn (Holy, Holy Holy), our Priest calls to mind and proclaims the words spoken by our Lord at the Last Supper held in the upper room. TAKE, EAT, THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH IS BROKEN FOR YOU, FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. TAKE, DRINK, THIS IS MY BLOOD OF THE NEW TESTAMENT, WHICH IS SHED FOR YOU AND FOR MANY, FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. We now find ourselves in the most sublime and solemn moment of the Liturgy. We are now in the midst of two great realities. We stand with one foot in the upper room of the Last Supper and with the other foot planted at the table of the great banquet, which will be celebrated in heaven at the close of the ages. With this in mind, we make our offering to God. The Priest lifts the Holy Paten and Chalice into the air and proclaims: THINE OWN OF THINE OWN, DO WE OFFER UNTO THEE, ON BEHALF OF ALL, AND FOR ALL. Isn't it ironic that all we really have to offer to God is God Himself, Jesus Christ present in the Eucharist. Truly, before God we possess nothing and have only the simple gifts He gave us to offer back to Him. As we sing the hymn, "We praise Thee, we bless Thee..." the Priest asks God to consecrate our gifts by the Holy Spirit.  No longer will our gifts be bread and wine. They are the very Body and very Blood of our Savior, Jesus Christ, consecrated by the descent and activity of the Holy Spirit.Only Orthodox Christians may receive communion, but at the conclusion of the liturgy everyone shares in blessed bread, which is distributed at the end of the service to all. The Eucharist is considered the Church's treasure, and it is reserved for those who have united themselves with Christ and the Church. </p>
				<h4>Conclusion of the Liturgy - When the Work Begins</h4>
				<p>Although our time in the Church building is coming to a close, our existence as the Body of Christ never ends. We have gathered and celebrated in prayer and sacrament so as to be made stronger to face the challenges of daily living. The work of the Liturgy is not begun until the Liturgy is concluded. As we go into the world and face the work and school week, we ought to reflect on the messages communicated to us through today's liturgical experience. The Divine Liturgy should remind us that we are the light of the world, the salt of the earth, and we must live that way. The Liturgy is the sign that we walk in light and in newness of life. Our daily living must be in accordance with what we have done here today. If this morning has passed in light and renewal then let us each live the coming week as people who are renewed by the light of the Eucharist. We will leave the Liturgy and bring the conscience of faith into the world. We ought to live as people of faith and conscience until we gather again in a holy Church to proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and the renewal that comes from them. Receiving Bread at the end of the service Before we leave, everyone receives blessed bread from our priest.  Again, today we have worshiped with all of our senses… seeing the icons, smelling the incense, touching one another with peace, hearing the music of praise, singing with our voices and tasting the bread of life. (The bread received at the end of the service is called antithron  - meaning “instead of the gifts”.) Through the grace of God, the goal of Orthodox life is "the 
acquisition of the Holy Spirit," the healing of soul and body, the transformation of our brokenness into wholeness, the transfiguration of the dark corners of our life into Christ-filled radiance, the participation in the worship of God by the whole creation, the surrender and unification of human creature to Divine Creator. The essence of our faith is establishing a direct, personal encounter between two persons - ourselves and God.</p>
				<p>We come to know God by spending time with Him, in daily prayer, in divine worship, in study of his personal letter to us--the Holy Bible, through use of the spiritual disciplines and spiritual treasures handed down to us by the Apostles themselves. </p>
				<h4>About the Orthodox Church</h4>
				<p>While the Orthodox Church has maintained unaltered its doctrines, scriptural interpretations and apostolic faith, it has continued to be dynamically sensitive to the guidance of the Holy Spirit, avoiding any tendency of becoming a museum of artifacts. She is true to the past, fully present in the now and assured of God’s promises concerning future things. Guided by the Holy Spirit, Orthodoxy has been able to transcend the ever-changing trends of every age, in order to be 
anchored to the unchangeable truths about God and the unbroken link to the historic faith of Jesus and His Apostle. The Lord Jesus Christ promised to send the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and disciples to keep them in truth and remind them of all He had done and taught. (John 16: 13-15) He further pledged Himself through the coming of this same Spirit to His disciples until the end 
of time. (Matthew.28: 18-20) The fulfillment of these promises is found in God’s preservation and perpetuation of the Orthodox Church throughout the ages.</p>

				<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/early_church.png" alt="">
				<p>For the first thousand years, Orthodox Christianity was essentially one church with five Patriarchal centers: Jerusalem, Antioch, Rome, Alexandria, and Constantinople. These Patriarchates formed a cohesive whole, living in full communion & community with one another. Occasionally, heretical disputes would occur and the responses to these were recorded in what is now known as The Seven Ecumenical Councils. Some schismatic groups did depart from the Church at various times, yet her core was unified until the 11th century when the Roman Patriarch separated from the rest, resulting in the Great Schism.</p> 
				<p>Nearly a thousand years after the Great Schism, the other four Patriarchal Churches have remained in full communion and virtually identical in practice to the Apostolic church inspired by New Testament record. The events of The Orthodox Church are listed below in chronological order from Pentecost to present day:</p>

				<h4>What is the Church?</h4>
				<h6 class="text-muted">By Fr. Evan Armatas, April 10, 2010</h6>
				<p>Not too long ago, a friend of mine who is not Orthodox challenged me with the following question: he wondered why Orthodox Christians couldn’t just get back to the Bible and use it as a means, like other Christian denominations had, for agreeing over what Christianity truly is. This same friend was concerned that many of the teachings and traditions that we, as Orthodox Christians, profess were not found in Holy Scripture. In the end, his feeling was that the true Christian faith had been corrupted and lost by the Orthodox Church and that a return to the Bible and its teachings would help us Orthodox separate those incorrect teachings and traditions we hold from what he deemed as “true, Bible-based Christianity.”</p>
				<p>Today, many share my friend’s opinion, and it is not difficult to notice that there is a proliferation of churches in America that claim to be Bible-based. Many of those who attend such churches are extremely faithful and wonderful people who are truly seeking to know Jesus Christ. Their sincere desire to walk with our Lord has prompted them to join a certain congregation, and through it, connect with their Savior.</p>
				<p>Many of our own parishes are full of similar people, men and women who want to follow Christ. In fact, many of our parishioners at one time belonged to another church or have family members who attend churches other than the Orthodox Church. Their journey to know Jesus just so happens to have brought them to the Orthodox Church, but we could argue that other peoples’ journeys have led them into the Methodist, Baptist, or Presbyterian churches.</p>
				<p>Without a doubt, all of us have friends who are not Orthodox Christians but who love Jesus and want to live a Christian life. This reality raises another question that I know many of us have struggled to answer. Namely, does it matter whether or not someone is an Orthodox Christian? Surely, Christians of other denominations are being saved and the truth that all of us are children of God is firmly established, so does it really matter what church you belong to, or is it just important that you belong to a church?</p>
				<p>To answer these questions, as well as the one raised by my friend, it is important that we first understand what the Church is. Scripture tells us in Colossians chapter 1 verse 18 that, “[Christ] is the head of the body, the Church.” We also learn from scripture that each of us, once baptized becomes, “members of his body,” (Ephesians 5.30). This same point is made in 1 Corinthians 6.15, when the Apostle Paul writes, “Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?” The Church, therefore, is Christ; He is its body, and each one of us are members of that body, the one body of Jesus Christ. Again, we can look to scripture for this exact definition, which can be found in 1 Corinthians 12.27, St. Paul writes, “Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.” There is one last point, however, that comes from scripture that we must investigate, and once again, this point relates to how we understand what a Church is. St. Paul asks the Church of Corinth the following question in 1 Corinthians 1.13: “Is Christ divided?” The answer, of course, is no. Christ is not divided; His body is whole. So we have learned from Holy Scripture that the Church is made up of Christ, who is its head, as well as each of us, who are members of that one undivided body.</p>
				<p>These statements St. Paul makes regarding the Church have enormous implications for those of us who live in the twenty-first century. For it is plain to see that the Christian faith is anything but whole; rather, it is splintered into thousands of expressions. In America alone, some estimate that the number of Christian traditions exceeds 5,000. Thus, the circumstance in which we find ourselves begs the question, “How did we get here?” How did Christianity become so fragmented, so divided, when Scripture tells us that there should be one Body? Even Jesus prayed that the Church would remain united. He said, “And now I am no more in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name, which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we are one, (John, 17.11).”</p>
				<p>When Jesus died, he did not leave us a book. He didn’t even leave us the New Testament, and as far as we know, he never wrote down a single thing on paper. What he did leave us, however, is His Church, a Church that He promised would never fail, a Church that the very gates of Hades would not overcome, Matthew 16.18. This means that if the Church had ceased to exist even for one moment, as some people propose, Christ would be a liar! More importantly, since the Church is headed by Christ Himself it is, therefore, Christ. So, if the Church had become corrupt, or even ceased to exist, Christ Himself would be corrupt or non-existent. Thankfully, this is not the case. Rather, we know that Christ’s Church has continued to exist, and its existence can be traced to the Day of Pentecost in Jerusalem. An unbroken connection exists between the first Church in Jerusalem, which was headed by the Bishop James, and our own parishes here in the United States and our beloved Bishops.</p>
				<p>Therefore, the unity of the Orthodox Church for 2000 years stands in stark contradiction to the fragmented Christianity of our modern century. It is interesting to note that the fragmentation of Christianity, the emergence of denominations and expressions, is rooted in my friend’s desire for us to return to just the Bible. In 1517, Martin Luther would post his thesis and set in motion the Protestant Reformation. At the center of Reformation was the concept of Sola Scriptura, only scripture (of course the concept of sola scriptura cannot be found anywhere in the Bible. In fact, the opposite argument is made by St. Paul in 2 Thessalonians, 2.15: “So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter,”). St. Paul commands the Corinthians to hold to those things they were taught by word-of-mouth, and those things they were taught by the written word. Throughout the centuries, the Orthodox Church has faithfully kept these traditions. For example, the Orthodox Church still professes the belief that the Eucharist is indeed the Body and Blood of Christ. This tradition is confirmed by Scripture in 1 Corinthians 10.16, “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not communion in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not communion in the Body of Christ?” Or Matthew, 26.26, where Christ commands his disciples to, “Take, eat; this is my body.”</p>
				<p>In working against the developments of the Catholic Church, the Reformers believed that a return to the scriptures alone would return the Church to the true faith in Jesus Christ. Thus, a movement was started that eventually led to the proliferation of denominations and interpretations of Holy Scripture. Once Holy Scripture was divorced from the Church and her traditions, its exegesis, or explanation, was left up to the individual. Missing from the Protestant’s mindset was the concept that scripture was never to be taken out of the context of the worshiping community. St. Peter had warned against such an abuse of scripture in his second letter 1.20, when he wrote, “First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.” Notice how St. Peter switches from the singular, man, to the plural, men, when speaking about proper interpretation. The community of the faithful was always the measure stick by which scripture was to be interpreted. Once this was removed, any one interpretation became valid.</p>
				<p>Today, you’ll find hundreds of interpretations of the same passage of scripture, and as a result, you’ll find thousands of different churches teaching different things. The irony is that all of them point to the Bible as the sole source of their interpretation! Once again, contrary to this fact, the Orthodox Church stands united in her witness to the faith and in the teachings she professes. Whether you attend an Orthodox Church in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, or Cape Town, South Africa, the teaching and the worship of these parishes is the same. This does not mean that the Orthodox Church looks down on other Christian expressions, nor does it mean that the Orthodox Church teaches intolerance or that she passes judgment on people who are members of other churches. Rather, the Orthodox Church simply witnesses to what she is by grace: the Church of Christ, established by her Lord, Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the Orthodox Church does not deny the activity of the Holy Spirit (or even salvation) cannot be found elsewhere beyond her walls, for God is great, and His love endures forever. However, she is assured of the Holy Spirit’s activity within. Finally, the Church knows that elements of the Truth can be found everywhere, but she alone possesses the full deposit of the faith, the entire inheritance of the sons and daughters of the Lord, is found only within her embrace.</p>
				<p>In the letter of Jude, we read in 1.3, “Beloved, being very eager to write to you of our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.” This letter, which was written by St. Jude, the brother of St. James, the first Bishop of Jerusalem, appeals to Christians to hold onto their common faith—the faith that was once and for all delivered to the saints, a faith rooted in the teaching of the Apostles, and a faith that is not subject to development or change. As the Apostle Paul wrote in Hebrews 13.8, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.”</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, my friend’s appeal is an appeal that leads to disaster, for it has resulted not in unity but disjointing. A simple return to the scriptures has resulted in the loss of the full deposit of faith for many. Our Protestant brothers and sisters are correct to encourage each Christian to learn scripture, to study God’s word, to commit their lives to Christ, and in a sense, to return to the Bible. However, each of us must do so under the guidance of the Church, which was established by Christ. Only then can we be assured that our own interpretation will be in line with that of the community established by Christ and cultivated by the Holy Apostles.</p>
				<p>In the end, the most convincing aspect of our faithful witness to Jesus Christ will be found in our ability to love. This means our argument for the Lord will be measured by the amount of love we show one another and those outside of the Church. If we do not open our hearts and love, any measure of disrespect, intolerance, or hate will totally destroy all messages that the Church might express. May your love for our Lord provide an ample witness that you are indeed one of His children.</p>

				<h4>Six Questions Concerning Orthodox Christianity...And How to Answer Them From the Bible</h4>
				<div class="chron-left">
					<h5>1. Does the Orthodox Church place tradition above or equal to Scripture?</h5>
					<p>The Church sees the Scriptures as inspired and authoritative Holy Tradition: the word of God. The key here is to see how the word "tradition" is used in the New Testament, which condemns the tradition of men but calls us to follow apostolic or holy tradition.</p>
					<h6>Tradition of Men</h6>
					<p>First of all, Jesus warned against holding to the "tradition of men" and "your tradition" in the strongest possible terms (see mark 7:6-16). All Christians agree: The Bible says no to the tradition of men.</p>
					<p>Secondly, Saint Paul warns in Colossians 2:8: "Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ." Here again, the phase "tradition of men" stands out, which the Orthodox Church condemns.</p>
					<h6>Holy Tradition</h6>
					<p>In distinction to the tradition of men, the Bible calls us to obey tradition which has God as its source. In II Thessalonians 2:15, Saint Paul writes, "Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle." In contrast to man's tradition, apostolic tradition is our foundation in the Church.</p>
					<p>Further, in II Thessalonians 3:6 we read, "But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received from us." Here again, we are dealing with Apostolic tradition, the tradition which God planted in the Church. Thus the Church is "the pillar and ground (or support) of the truth" (I Timothy 3:15).</p>
					<p>All true tradition comes from the same source: the Holy Spirit in the Church. The same One who inspired holy Scripture prompted the on-location teaching of the Apostles, whether written or oral (II Thes. 2:15). Further, it was on the basis of Church tradition that the Biblical canon was determined.</p>
					<p>Tradition is giving our ancestors a vote. It is walking in the "path of righteousness for His name's sake" (Psalm 23:3). Or, as Jeremiah writes, living by holy tradition is a call from God Himself. "Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then you will find rest for your souls" (Jer. 6:16).Thus, there are two kinds of tradition: that of God and that of men. It is to the former that the Orthodox Church is singularly committed.</p>
					<h5>2. How does the Orthodox Church view communion?</h5>
					<p>Some Protestant groups teach that communion, or the Lord's Supper, is only a sign or symbol. Most all of Christendom, however, believes it is far more. The Orthodox Church has always believed that we, in a mystery, receive the body and blood of Christ. Let us look at Holy Scripture concerning Communion.</p>
					<p>Jesus said at the Last Supper: "This is my body" and "This cup is ...my blood" (Luke 22: 19 and 20, italics added). The Lord is clear that His gifts to us are more than just sign or a mere memorial.</p>
					<p>In I Corinthians 11:29, 30, we read of people who became sick and even died for receiving communion hypocritically. People do not die over something merely "symbolic." The bread and wine is, in mystery, the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
					<p>In I Corinthians 10, Saint Paul is comparing the manna and water in the wilderness with the true bread and drink of the New Covenant. In I Corinthians 10:4 he writes, "And all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ." The question is, was the Rock Christ? Under laboratory observation, the rock was still most likely granite. But the word of God says, "The Rock was Christ." We do not subject the gifts to chemical analysis, but to the word of God. It's mystery, but never magic. Christ was present in the Rock as He is present in the Holy Gifts.</p>
					<p>In John 6:53 we read, "Then Jesus said to them, 'Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you.'" The Church receives this passage at face value — nothing added, nothing taken away. In communion we become partakers of the body and blood of Christ. Just as the new birth (John 3) gives us life through water and the Holy Spirit, so the body and blood of Christ sustains His life in us.</p>
					<p>Christ our High Priest enters the Heavenly Sanctuary with His own blood (Hebrews 9:11-12), and it is in this Heavenly Sanctuary that we worship (Hebrews 10: 19-25). There is only one Eucharist, the one in heaven, and we join in that one feast.</p>
					<p>For further insights on the subject, see the article, “The Eucharist” in the Orthodox Study Bible — New Testament.</p>
					<p>We must neither add to nor subtract from the word of God. Therefore we confess with Holy Scripture that the consecrated bread and wine is the body and blood of Christ. It is a mystery: we do not pretend to know how or why. As always, we come to Christ in childlike faith, receive His gifts, and offer Him praise that He has called us to His heavenly banquet.</p>
					<h5>3. Why does the Orthodox Church emphasize the role of Mary?</h5>
					<p>Let us turn to the New Testament and see what God says about Mary. A key passage is Luke 1:26-49.</p>
					<p>The Archangel Gabriel calls the Virgin Mary "highly favored" with God (see also Luke 1:30) and the most "blessed" of all women (Luke 1:28). We must never do less.</p>
					<p>In Luke 1:42, 43, Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, also calls Mary "blessed," and "the mother of my Lord." Can we make the same confession? For centuries, the Church with one voice has called Mary the mother of God. If God was not in her womb, we are dead in our sins. By "mother of God" we do not mean, of course, that she is mother of the Holy Trinity. She is the human mother of the eternal Son of God. Mary bore God in her womb, and thus we can rightly call her the Theotokos, or God-bearer.</p>
					<p>Not only does Elizabeth call her blessed, Mary herself, inspired by the Holy Spirit, predicts, "All generations will call me blessed" (Luke 1:48). This biblical prophecy explains the Orthodox hymn, "It is truly right to bless you, O Theotokos." Tragically, our generation has forgotten to call her blessed. Orthodox Christians bless her in obedience to God, fulfilling His holy words.</p>
					<p>It is important to secure Mary's identity as the mother of God to protect the identity of her holy Son, "the Son of the Highest" (Luke 1:32), God in the flesh. If we cannot face up to Mary, we will miss the incarnation of the Son of God.</p>
					<p>The Old Testament Prophet Ezekiel writes, "This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, because the Lord God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut" (Ezekiel 44:2). The early Church Fathers consistently saw this gate as a picture of the womb of Mary, shut after Jesus' birth. We do not worship Mary.</p>
					<p>Worship is reserved only for God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We honor or venerate Mary, the mother of God, as the Scriptures teach.</p>
					<h5>4. Why do Orthodox Christians honor the saints?</h5>
					<p>The Scriptures themselves call us to honor other Christians, both the living and departed.</p>
					<p>In Acts 28:10, St. Luke writes, "they honored us (the Apostolic band) in many ways." The biblical injunction concerning Mary, "All generations will call me blessed" (Luke 1:48), is an example of how we are to honor the saints for all time (see also Heb. 11:4-40).</p>
					<p>We are to honor all believers and true authorities, not just departed ones. This is why Saint Paul exhorts us to honor one another (1 Timothy 5:17), and why Saint Peter tells husbands to honor their wives (1 Peter 3:7). May we gain back true honor, both in the Church and in the culture.</p>
					<p>In Orthodox worship, we see pictures or icons of the believers of history all around us. This is, in part, how we honor our forerunners in the faith. In Hebrews 12:22-24 we read that in worship we join with the heavenly throng to praise and worship God. We come to join "an innumerable company of angels," "the general assembly and church of the first- born who are registered in heaven" and "the spirits of just men made perfect." And as "in spirit and in truth" we join these angelic and redeemed heroes of the faith, we do give them proper honor as the Scripture teaches.</p>
					<p>Some modern Christians tend to give notice primarily to living Christian heroes, often newly-believing athletes, beauty queens and political figures. But throughout Church history, honor went to those who finished the race (I Corinthians 9:24-27), not to those who have merely begun or who are still on the earthly track (Galatians 5:7). These saints of old are not dead, but alive in Christ forever!</p>
					<h5>5. Do the icons of Orthodoxy border on idolatry?</h5>
					<p>In Orthodox Christianity, icons are never worshipped; but they are honored, or venerated.</p>
					<p>The Second Commandment says, "You shall not make for yourself any carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth" (Exodus 20:4-5). The warning here is that we are not to image things which are limited to heaven and therefore unseen, and we never bow down to or worship created, earthly things such as the golden calf. Does this condemn all imagery in worship? The Bible speaks for itself, and the answer is no.</p>
					<p>Just five chapters later, in Exodus 25, God gives His divine blueprint, if you will, for the tabernacle. Specifically in verses 19 and 20, he commands images of cherubim be placed above the mercy seat. So true imagery is not condemned in Scripture, but false imagery. Also, God promises to meet and speak with us through this imagery! (Exodus 25:22).</p>
					<p>In Exodus 26:1, Israel was commanded in no uncertain terms to sew "artistic designs of cherubim" in the tabernacle curtains. Are these images? Absolutely! In fact, they are Old Testaments icons. And they are images God commanded.</p>
					<p>From the beginning the Church imaged heavenly things brought to earth: Christ Himself, the Cross (Galatians 6:14), and the saints of God (Hebrews 11 and 12). Worship is reserved for the Holy Trinity alone. Icons depicting Christ, the primary subject of Orthodox iconography, help make Christ more present. Christ is worshipped, not wood and paint. Likewise, we honor the great men and women of the faith by remembering them in the Orthodox Church via visual aids, called icons or windows to heaven.</p>
					<h5>6. What do Orthodox Christians believe about liturgy?</h5>
					<p>Biblically and historically true worship consistently has been liturgical. "Spontaneous" worship is an innovation of the last century or so.</p>
					<p>Liturgical worship, written Prayers (the Psalms) and feast days were the norm throughout the history of Israel (see Exodus 23:14-19; 24:1-30:38; etc.).</p>
					<p>The worship of heaven is liturgical (Isa. 6:1-90; Heb. 8:1-3; Rev. 4).</p>
					<p>The foundations of liturgical worship in the Church are apparent in the New Testament. The most oft-repeated prayer of the Church is there (Matthew 6:9-13). The words we say at baptism are there (Matthew 28:19). The words spoken at Holy Communion are there, with St. Paul repeating Jesus' words (I Corinthians 11:23-26). Further, the believers in Acts 13:2, about 49 A.D., were seen in a liturgical service to the Lord: "As they ministered (Gk: leitourgouaton, our root word for liturgy!) to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said...." Note, too, in this passage that the Holy Spirit speaks to us during liturgical worship. Thus praise to God must never become dead form, but rather living worship, "in spirit and truth" (John 4:23-24).</p>
					<p>Documents like the Didache (70 A.D.), the writings of St. Justin Martyr (150 A.D.) and Hipploytus (early 200s) all show the worship of the early Church was, without exception, liturgical. Because of their disdain for Rome, some Protestant groups have reacted by dismissing liturgical worship (though everyone has patterned worship, "spontaneous" or not!) But the Bible and Church history are clear; liturgical worship is the norm for the people of God.</p>

                <h2 class="text-uppercase">Marriage at Holy Apostles</h2>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">We rejoice with those who are united in the sacrament of marriage. This is a lifelong commitment, mystically uniting two people as one. “...the two shall become one flesh.” (Ephesians 5:31)</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/marriage.png" alt="">
                <h4>About the Sacrament of Marriage</h4>
				<p>As we participate in the marriage of a man and a woman, we witness an ancient ceremony rich in symbolism and alive in the Holy Spirit. The Sacrament of Marriage in the Orthodox Church is not simply a contract between two people; it is a living representation of God's grace in their lives and a symbol of their acceptance that God has brought them together and will sustain them in peace and oneness of mind throughout their lifetime.</p>
				<p>The ceremony is composed of two distinct services, that of the Betrothal and that of the Sacrament of Marriage. Both are laden with symbolic actions. The prayers throughout the service call to mind holy figures from the Old and New Testaments who lived lives of righteousness and who found happiness and marital fulfillment through their faith in God.</p>
				<h4>The Rings</h4>
				<p>The exchanging of rings is the focus of the Service of Betrothal. The rings, which the bride and groom have brought to the church, are blessed by the priest and placed on their fingers as a symbol of their lifelong commitment to one another, and as a symbol of the authority that each of them will have in the new family that they are creating. It is the "Koumbaro" (the couple's religious sponsor), who passes the rings between the bride and the groom three times "in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit." The koumbaro is our representative as a community witness to this vow of faithfulness .</p>
				<h4>The Joining of Hands</h4>
				<p>As the bride and groom join hands, we pray that they are united in one mind and one flesh for a lifetime together.</p>
				<h4>The Candles</h4>
				<p>Christ said, "I am the light of the world." The candles symbolize the willingness of the bride and groom to receive Christ as the guiding light who will illuminate and bless them throughout their lives.</p>
				<h4>The Crowns</h4>
				<p>The crowning of the couple is the focus of the Sacrament of Marriage. The crowns themselves are richly symbolic. Throughout history, crowns have symbolized honor, glory, authority and responsibility - all of which are manifest in the new roles that the husband and wife are accepting. In the Christian tradition they are also associated with martyrdom, a reminder that the bride and groom will be called upon to make sacrifices for one another throughout the years. A ribbon connects the crowns; signifying that from henceforth, they will experience the joys and responsibilities of life joined together common purpose.</p>
				<h4>The Readings</h4>
				<p>The Epistle Reading of Saint Paul's letter to the Ephesians (5 :20-33) describes the mystery and holiness of Christian marriage and responsibilities to love one another with Christ-like love and sacrifice. In the Gospel according to Saint John (2: 1-11) Christ blesses the sacred institute of marriage and performs his first miracle at the wedding at Cana in Galilee.</p>
				<h4>The Common Cup</h4>
				<p>Following the reading of the Epistle and the Gospel, the couple is presented a goblet of wine from which to drink. Reminiscent of Christ's first miracle at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, the wine is presented as a symbol of the "cup of life" that husband and wife will share from this day forward.</p>
				<h4>The Dance Procession</h4>
				<p>The priest joins hands with the newly married couple leading them into their first steps as husband and wife. The 'priest holds the Gospel which will guide them throughout their life together. The three-fold procession around the table is known as the Dance of Isaiah. Three sets of hymns are sung as bride and groom take their first steps as husband and wife. The first hymn describes the joy of the prophet Isaiah when he envisioned the coming of the Messiah; the second is a hymn celebrating the joy of the holy martyrs when they received their crowns of glory; the third is a hymn of exaltation to the Holy Trinity.</p>
				<h4>Final Blessing</h4>
				<p>At the end of the service, before the final blessing of the bride and groom, the priest removes the crowns from their heads offering them to God with the words, "Receive their crowns in Your Kingdom, preserving them spotless, blameless and without reproach unto the ages of ages." It is with this prayer in mind that the newly married couple departs from the church in joy, in love and in peace!</p>
				<h4>COORDINATING YOUR WEDDING </h4>
				<p>Our administrative staff will work with you in all matters pertaining to your wedding, including setting the date, scheduling meetings with Fr. Tom, and preparing the necessary church and civil documents.</p>
				<h4>SETTING THE DATE</h4>
				<p>A couple desiring to be married should first contact the church office to schedule an appointment with Fr. Tom. According to the official policies of our Archdiocese and Metropolis, weddings may not be celebrated during the fasting seasons or the major feast days of our Church:</p>
				<div class="books-left">
					<p>• December 13-25 (The Advent and Christmas season)</p>
					<p>• January 5-6 (Epiphany or Theophany )</p>
					<p>• February 2  (the Presentation of the Lord to the Temple)</p>
					<p>• Great Lent and Holy Week (usually mid-February, the entire month of March, and part of April)</p>
					<p>• August 1-15 (the Dormition fast of the Theotokos)</p>
					<p>• August 29 (the beheading of John the Baptist)</p>
					<p>• September 14 (the Exaltation of the Cross)</p>
					<p>• The Ascension (Moveable feast day - changes every year)</p>
					<p>• Pentecost (Moveable feast day - changes every year)</p>
				</div>
				<h4>Marriage is a Holy Sacrament in the Orthodox Church.</h4>
				<p>Here are the guidelines for each couple desiring to participate in this Holy Sacrament: At least one of the couple to be married is an Orthodox Christian, baptized and /or chrismated in the Orthodox Church, committed to Christ and His Church, and an active steward for at least a year prior to the date of the wedding. The intended spouse, if not Orthodox, should be a Christian baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as commanded by the Lord (Matthew 28:19).</p>
				<p>Because marriage is a sacrament and the couple not only pledge their love for each other but also their love for Christ, a wedding between an Orthodox Christian and a non-Christian may not be celebrated in the Church.</p>
				<h4>NECESSARY PAPERS AND DOCUMENTS</h4>
				<p>The following documentation is needed two months in advance of your wedding date to ensure that your wedding will meet the criteria established by the Church and local civil authorities:</p>
				<div class="books-left">
					<p>1. Verification of the baptism and stewardship commitment of the Orthodox spouse(s);</p>
					<p>2. Verification of the baptism of the non-Orthodox spouse in a Christian community that baptizes in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (for example, the Roman Catholic and, traditionally, mainline Protestant churches such as the Lutheran and Episcopalian communities);</p>
					<p>3. An ecclesiastical marriage license; and</p>
					<p>4. A civil marriage license.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Because of the separation of Church and state, two marriage licenses are necessary, one for the Church and one for the state.</p>
				<h4>IN CASE OF PRIOR MARRIAGES</h4>
				<p>If either of the parties has been previously married, the death certificate of the deceased spouse or the civil divorce decree issued by the state must be presented to the parish priest.  If the prior marriage was celebrated in the Orthodox Church and ended in divorce, then an ecclesiastical divorce decree must also be presented.</p>
				<h4>THE WEDDING PARTY</h4>
				<p>The “koumbaro” or “koumbara” — the sponsor who will participate sacramentally in the service by exchanging the rings and the crowns that form an integral part of the marriage rite — must be an Orthodox Christian and a steward of his/her parish.  The “koumbaro” or “koumbara,” if from another Orthodox parish, must provide a letter from his/her parish priest certifying his/her active stewardship in the life of the Church.  Other members of the wedding party need not be Orthodox.</p>
				<h4>NECESSARY ITEMS FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE SERVICE</h4>
				<p>Among the items necessary to celebrate one’s marriage in the Church are the following:</p>
				<div class="books-left">
					<p>1. A pair of rings</p>
					<p>2. A pair of “stefana”/wedding crowns; and</p>
					<p>3. A pair of white candles.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Some couples also choose to provide a silver or gold chalice and tray.  These latter items are optional for the couple as the parish can provide them if necessary.</p>
				<h4>PREPARATION FOR MARRIAGE</h4>
				<p>In addition to meeting with Fr. Tom, preparation for your marriage at Holy Apostles should also include 6 pre-marital counseling sessions, with an appropriate marriage family therapist to help support you in the process of preparing for your marriage. As you prepare for marriage in the Orthodox Church, it is important to meet regularly with Fr. Tom, actively participate in the life of the church, and attend Divine Liturgy regularly as well as our Sunday Adult Oasis Classes in order to be firmly grounded in the Orthodox Christian understanding of life.</p>
				<h4>Marriage: The Great Sacrament</h4>
				<h6 class="text-muted">Excerpts from a sermon delivered in the Church of St. Nicholas, Trikala, Greece, 17 January, 1971 - By Archimandrite Aimilianos of Simonopetra, Mount Athos</h6>
				<p>When two people get married, it's as if they're saying: Together we will go forward, hand in hand, through good times and bad. We will have dark hours, hours filled with struggles and burdens. But in the depths of the night, we continue to believe in the sun and the light. Oh, my dear friends, who can say that his life has not been marked by difficult moments? But it is no small thing to know that, in your difficult moments, in your worries, in your temptations, you will be holding in your hand the hand of your beloved. The New Testament says that every person will have pain, especially those who enter into marriage.</p>
				<p>Marriage is a journey of love. It is the creation of a new human being, a new person, for, as theGospel says, "the two will be as one flesh" (Mt 19.5; Mk 10.7). God unites two people, and makes them one. From this union of two people, who agree to synchronize their footsteps and harmonize the beating of their hearts, a new human being emerges. Through such profound and spontaneous love, the one becomes a presence, a living reality, in the heart of the other. "I am married" means that I cannot live a single day, even a few moments, without the companion of my life. My husband, my wife, is a part of my being, of my flesh, of my soul. He or she complements me. He or she is the thought of my mind. He or she is the reason for which my heart beats.</p>
				<p>The couple exchanges rings to show that, in life's changes, they will remain united. Each wears a ring with the name of the other written on it, which is placed on the finger from which a vein runs directly to the heart. That is, the name of the other is written on his own heart. The one, we could say, gives the blood of his heart to the other. He or she encloses the other within the core of his being. The most fundamental thing in marriage is love, and love is about uniting two into one. I am bound up with the other. I live for the other, and for that reason I tolerate his faults. A person who can't put up with another can't marry.</p>
				<p>Marriage is first of all a journey of pain; second a journey of love; and, third, a journey to heaven, a call from God. It is, as Holy Scripture says, a "great mystery" (Eph 5.32). We often speak of seven "mysteries," or sacraments. In this regard, a "mystery" is the sign of the mystical presence of some true person or event. An icon, for instance, is a mystery. When we venerate it, we are not venerating wood or paint, but Christ, or the Theotokos, or the saint who is mystically depicted. The Holy Cross is a symbol of Christ, containing his mystical presence. Marriage, too, is a mystery, a mystical presence, not unlike these. Christ says, "wherever two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am among them" (Mt 18.20). And whenever two people are married in the name of Christ, they become the sign which contains and expresses Christ himself. When you see a couple who are conscious of this, it is as if you are seeing Christ. Together they are a theophany.</p>
				<p>This is also why crowns are placed on their heads during the wedding ceremony, because the bride and groom are an image of Christ and the Church. And not just this, but everything in marriage is symbolic. The lit candles symbolize the wise virgins. When the priest places these candles into the hands of the newly-weds, it is as if he is saying to them: Wait for Christ like the wise virgins (Mt 25.1-11). Or they symbolize the tongues of fire which descended at Pentecost, and which were in essence the presence of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2.1-4). The wedding rings are kept on the altar, until they are taken from there by the priest, which shows that marriage has its beginning in Christ, and will end in Christ. The priest also joins their hands, in order to show that it is Christ himself who unites them. It is Christ who is at the heart of the mystery and at the center of their lives.</p>
				<p>All the elements of the marriage ceremony are shadows and symbols which indicate the presence of Christ. When you're sitting somewhere and suddenly you see a shadow, you know that someone's coming. You don't see him, but you know he's there. You get up early in the morning, and you see the red horizon in the east. You know that, in a little while, the sun will come up. And indeed, there behind the mountain, the sun starts to appear.</p>
				<p>When you see your marriage, your husband, your wife, your partner's body, when you see your troubles, everything in your home, know that they are all signs of Christ's presence. It is as if you're hearing Christ's footsteps, as if he was coming, as if you are now about to hear his voice. All these things are the shadows of Christ, revealing that he is together with us. It is true, though, that, because of our cares and worries, we feel that he is absent. But we can see him in the shadows, and we are sure that he is with us. This is why there was no separate marriage service in the early Church. The man and woman simply went to church and received Communion together. What does this mean? That henceforth their life is one life in Christ.</p>
				<p>The wreaths, or wedding crowns, are also symbols of Christ's presence. More specifically, they are symbols of martyrdom. Husband and wife wear crowns to show that they are ready to become martyrs for Christ. To say that "I am married" means that I live and die for Christ. "I am married" means that I desire and thirst for Christ. Crowns are also signs of royalty, and thus husband and wife are king and queen, and their home is a kingdom, a kingdom of the Church, an extension of the Church.</p>
				<p>The wreaths also symbolize the final victory which will be attained in the kingdom of heaven. When the priest takes the wreaths, he says to Christ: "take their crowns to your kingdom," take them to your kingdom, and keep them there, until the final victory. And so marriage is a road: its starts out from the earth and ends in heaven. It is a joining together, a bond with Christ, who assures us that he will lead us to heaven, to be with him always. Marriage is a bridge leading us from earth to heaven. It is as if the sacrament is saying: Above and beyond love, above and beyond your husband, your wife, above the everyday events, remember that you are destined for heaven, that you have set out on a road which will take you there without fail. The bride and the bridegroom give their hands to one another, and the priest takes hold of them both, and leads them round the table dancing and singing. Marriage is a movement, a progression, a journey which will end in heaven, in eternity.</p>
				<p>In marriage, it seems that two people come together. However, it's not two but three. The man marries the woman, and the woman marries the man, but the two together also marry Christ. So three take part in the mystery, and three remain together in life.</p>

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/child_baptism.png" alt="">
                <p>It is truly an honor and blessing for us at Holy Apostles to baptize your child.  We will do our best to support you and your family as you grow in Christ at Holy Apostles.</p>
				<p>It is also our responsibility to encourage you, as a parent and as a human being, to live a life in Christ, which means worshiping God at an Orthodox church on a regular basis, receiving the sacraments, keeping a prayer life, and being a current steward in the Orthodox Church.</p>
				<p>If you are new to our community and have not been regularly attending an Orthodox Church, you are invited and encouraged to come worship and pray with us.</p>
				<p>Before a baptism is celebrated, it is important that you and your family worship with us for three months prior to considering baptism at Holy Apostles. This is essential as you dedicate this three-month commitment to foster a spiritual discipline, to strengthen your life in Christ, and to begin a new pattern and spiritual journey with your child and family.</p>
				<p>Baptism is likened to being grafted to the tree of Life, Jesus Christ, and we will do what we can to help your child grow into the person she/he was intended to be by God.  To accomplish this sacred task, regular church attendance is expected.</p>
				<p>Baptism makes the person a full member and participant in the body of Christ.  And the Church has the responsibility to offer this sacrament to those who intend to live an active Orthodox Christian life.</p>
				<p>If you have previously baptized a child at Holy Apostles or any other Greek Orthodox Church and you and your family have not been attending services, or participating in the sacramental life of the church, a request to have another child baptized at the Church will have to be discussed with the priest.</p>
				<p>"Good Standing" Requirements for an Orthodox Christian to be a Godparent:</p>
				<div class="books-left">
					<p>• Must be an Orthodox Christian in good standing</p>
					<p>• A registered Steward of an Orthodox Parish</p>
					<p>• If married, must have been married in an Orthodox Church</p>
					<p>• If married in the Orthodox Church but  now divorced, must obtain an Ecclesiastical divorce decree</p>
				</div>
				<p>Please prayerfully consider choosing a godparent to be a support for your child’s spiritual journey. This is a lifelong commitment for the Godparent, who will be praying for and encouraging their godchild to live a full life in Christ.</p>
				<p>We look forward to this sacred day. Please feel free to contact Fr. Tom with any questions or to schedule a baptism.</p>

                <p>“...Repentance is the renewal of life.  It is not a looking backward but moving forward and leaning forward towards Jesus.  This means we must free ourselves of all our negative traits and turn toward absolute Good, towards Christ.”  † Elder Thaddeus</p>
				<p>Confession is an important part of the prescription for healing and growth that Christ gave us through the early church.</p>
				<p>We need repentance! We fall many times during our life, and it is absolutely necessary to reveal everything (in confession) before a priest who is a witness to our repentance.  You see, repentance is not a formality of going to a priest in confession.  It is a true desire to free ourselves from the obsession of negative thoughts.  It is commitment to resist thoughts and actions that ‘eat at our soul’. And practice actions and engage with thoughts that ‘feed our soul’!</p>
				<p>Repentance is the act of our re-integration into the healing body of the faithful, our way toward reconciliation with Christ and the community of believers.  "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just, and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9). The Apostle James wrote in a similar vein: "Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed." (James 5:16).</p>
				<p>Dn. John Chryssavgis writes in his book “Soul Mending, “When I can confess my peculiarity, my brokenness to someone who does not shame me, who will stand as a representative of the community and as a witness before God, then my healing can begin.  When I take off the mask, and – together with at least one other person-look clearly at my vulnerability then my recovery and restoration has begun."</p>
				<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to <a href="mailto:t.tsagalakis@comcast.net" target="_top">contact Fr. Tom</a>!</p>
				<h4>Reflections on Confession</h4>
				<p>It is hard to imagine a deep friendship or marriage without some sort of forgiveness being asked of one another.  As we dance together in life we have surely stepped on each other’s toes at some point and have felt hurt by the other and for sure have regretfully ‘caused’ suffering as well.</p>
				<p>You know the feeling.  When this happens, we will feel awkward, distant, and perhaps angry or become silent.  We feel blamed and judged, wronged. Or ‘we’ blame, judge, or hurt others. Sometimes our body stiffens, our chest tightens, we get headaches, become irritable, out of sorts, etc.</p>
				<p>If you have done something that hurts or distorts or distances a deep, loving relationship; naming, claiming it, and saying I’m sorry for what has happened is essential to its restoration.  "Asking for forgiveness is what we do to protect, renew, and restore our relationships when they have been damaged!"</p>
				<p>For the sake of that love and friendship, you confess what you've done, you apologize for what you’ve said, and you strive ‘not’ to do it again.  I am sure you have felt in your heart, your body, your mind a sort of uncomfortable feeling when you have been hurt or someone has hurt you intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
				<p>And you know what it is like when that friendship or relationship is restored and you are able to re-connect and just be you.  Our church is asking you to ‘just be you,' the you that you were created to be, the you that chooses to respond in a loving, peaceful and powerful way, the you that is grounded and clear, the you that thirsts for God, the you that has a heart for a relationship with God.</p>
				<p>To assist us in becoming ‘us’ and to help us restore our relationship with God and one another, our church invites and encourages the faithful to come to confession.</p>
				<p>According to Dn. John Chryssavgis, confession can be looked at as a forward movement ‘into’ life. It is not an invitation to hopeless guilt - but to freedom and responsibility.  The purpose is not that we be ashamed or demoralized but it is rather to point us towards life; a life characterized by honesty, integrity and personal accountability to God, to all others, and to oneself.</p>
				<p>“To repent is to awaken from the sleep of ignorance, to rediscover our soul, to gain the meaning and purpose of our lives by responding to the incomparable love of the One who is ‘not’ of this world, the One who ‘demonstrates’ His own love toward us.  The focal point should not be our imperfection but the perfect love of Jesus, who is good and loves humankind.”</p>
				<p>We should not conceal or hold private, our pain, our problems, our passions.  ‘If’ we listen to them and respond to them with boldness and with the Grace of God they may show us how to love and be closer to God, others and our self!</p>
				<p>Deacon John speaks about the power in being able to confess our peculiarity, our brokenness to someone who does not shame us, who will stand as a representative and as a witness before God, then our healing can begin.</p>
				<p>“When we are able to take off our mask, and together with at least one person look clearly at our vulnerability without judgement and full loving acceptance for who we are, then our recovery and restoration has begun.”</p>
				<p>This is not easy, self awareness can be troublesome but nevertheless ‘necessary’ for us to have new life.  Socrates said, “the unexamined life is a life not worth living”.  There is something healing and life-giving in the simple act of examining and verbally sharing one’s private burden with one’s spiritual father.</p>
				<p>It is important to be brutally honest with ourselves before our spiritual father.  “We ought to be wary of any dishonest ‘niceness’ in our relationships, in our marriage, and in our churches, which undermines the process of consultation and the sense of community”.</p>
				<p>Having said all this I know it is most difficult to confess our sins and it is never easy admitting doing something that we regret and are ashamed of, an act we’ve kept secret or denied, or blamed someone else for.  There are many times we argued to ourself that it wasn’t really ‘that’ bad as others might think. So we bury these sins, these feelings, these secrets deep inside only to have them surface at the most inopportune times of our life.</p>
				<p>Jim Forrest states that we were designed for confession and that secrets in general are hard to keep; and if they are not confessed rarely go away - but have a way of making life harder, heavier, and unbearable as time passes.  Isn’t this true, the more we hold on to the lie, the suffering, the blame, the anger, the hurt, the more our heart becomes heavy, the more we feel depressed and hopeless...you know what I mean.</p>
				<p>“You see we are called to love, not to pretend; to be holy, not to be ‘nice’, to be connected, not disconnected, to be balanced and grounded.   Clearly confession is not only remembering the past wrongs, not only reciting a list of how we hurt God and others,  but confession should be about reconnecting ourselves as members of Christ’s body and one another.”</p>
				<p>In the community of the church, we learn to share our weakness and to shed our tears, to love and to be loved.  We recognize that we do not have to be perfect for people to love us.  We must recognize that we 'all' are broken and are in need of grace, understanding and compassion.  We learn that we must stop judgment of others 'and' ourself!!!</p>
