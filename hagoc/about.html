			<h4>At Holy Apostles...</h4>
			<p>We are on a journey to build a vibrant, Christ-centered, Spirit-filled community of faith that serves as a witness to the love God has for us all. Just as the Holy Apostles were called by Christ to spread the "Good News" to all people, so is the vision of our parish to share the Gospel of Christ with one and all. We are a sacramental, life-changing church. At Holy Apostles, we strive to develop a life of prayer and to grow meaningful, honest relationships as we care for those around us.</p>
			<p class="item-intro text-muted">I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!" (Philippians 4:13)</p>
			
			<h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
			<p>More and more people throughout the world are becoming aware of our Orthodox Christian Faith. This is the original Christian Church, the one Jesus taught His Apostles to share with the world. We are still here, and as people learn what Orthodoxy teaches, they realize the stability and continuity waiting for them in a Church that preserves the gifts it received in New Testament times and brings them to the world today. We invite you to learn more about our Church and our parish family by joining us for worship and fellowship. Whether you are an Orthodox Christian, new to the area, a member of another religious tradition, or simply curious about Orthodoxy, Holy Apostles welcomes you. We invite you to experience Orthodox Christianity, both through the original teachings upheld by our Church for nearly 2000 years, and through the dynamic "heavenly" worship experiences our tradition offers. As a growing mission parish (established in 1999) we strive to be a community offering Orthodox Christianity to all people. Our services are sung together "with one voice and one heart" primarily in English. We invite all to "come and see."</p>
			
			<h4>Our Mission</h4>
			<p id="whattoexpect">Our mission is to be an extended village, welcoming and encouraging both adults and children to participate in the Orthodox Christian Faith, as we grow together, like the Holy Apostles, to know, love, and serve Jesus Christ.</p>
			
			<br>
			<h4>What to expect on a Sunday?</h4>
			<p>1. The very first thing we would like you to do is simple: relax.</p>
			<p>We hope your experience engaging in Orthodox Christian worship will be filled with wonderful sights, smells, and songs as we open our hearts and lift up our prayers to God - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
			<p>2. We worship as Christ taught his original Apostles, holding sacred the teachings and traditions of the early Christian Church.</p>
			<p><b>Everyone is welcome here.</b></p>
			<p>Whatever your story, your questions, whatever your ethnic background, whatever your doubts or struggles. Come as you are, because that’s where God meets us. From there, we’ll help each other grow to be all God intended us to be.</p>
			<p>Here's What You Should Expect When You Visit Us:</p>
			<p>At Holy Apostles we have a diverse and friendly community. The highlight of our week is gathering on Sunday morning for worship. The Divine Liturgy is the ancient service focusing on both hearing and teaching the Word of God (the Bible) and receiving the Sacrament of Holy Communion during each Liturgy. Throughout the service, we encourage everyone to sing and pray together with one voice and one heart.</p>
			<p>To receive communion in the Orthodox Church, one must be a baptized Orthodox Christian. But everyone is invited to receive blessed bread from our priest at the end of the service. </p>
			<p>During the “Kiss of Peace,” we greet one another saying “Christ is in our midst” with the response “He is, and always shall be.” During this time some will shake hands or share an embrace. If you're uncomfortable with this, just say good morning. We won't be offended.</p>
			<p>The Priest will offer a homily (sermon) after the Gospel reading for the day. (Usually about 10 minutes).</p>
			<p>The entire service is about an hour and a half.</p>
			<p>At the end of the service, we receive a greeting from our priest and blessed bread. This is for ALL who attend the Divine Liturgy.</p>
			<p>Be sure to join us for a cup of coffee and lunch in our fellowship hall. We want to meet you!</p>
			<p>Following fellowship hour, we break into simultaneous groups for Sunday School.</p>
			<p><b>Adults</b> - OASIS (Orthodox Adults and Students in Study) Adults in our community enjoy in-depth presentations and discussions.</p>
			<p><b>Kids</b> - Fun, age-appropriate classes. </p>
